# Progress Log

## February 25, 2024
- Implemented API key management system
  - Created database tables for users and API keys
  - Added ability to create API keys
  - Added ability to delete API keys
  - Added ability to update API keys
  - Integrated with NextAuth for user authentication
  - Set up Supabase service role for secure backend operations

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Key Validation Issue
- **Problem**: The validation function was failing to validate API keys that existed in the database
- **Root Cause**: The validation function had issues with the Supabase client or query structure
- **Solution**: Implemented a direct database check in the GitHub service using the Supabase client
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/services/github.js`: Added direct database check for API key validation
  - `app/api/validate-key/route.ts`: Added POST handler with direct database check

### 2. GitHub Summarizer Response Structure
- **Problem**: The GitHub summarizer was failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'summary')"
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between expected and actual structure of the chain output
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling to handle different possible result structures
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/services/github.js`: Added structure validation and fallback options
  - `app/api/github-summarizer/route.ts`: Updated response format to only include analysis

### 3. Debugging Tools Added
- Added test endpoints to help diagnose API key validation issues
- Created character-by-character comparison for API keys to detect encoding issues
- **Files Added**:
  - `app/api/test-db/route.ts`: Endpoint to view all API keys in the database
  - `app/api/test-key/route.ts`: Endpoint to test specific API key validation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Direct Database Queries**: Sometimes a direct database query is more reliable than a complex validation function, especially when troubleshooting.

2. **Robust Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling that can deal with unexpected data structures, especially when working with AI models.

3. **Debugging Endpoints**: Creating specific debugging endpoints can help isolate and identify issues in complex systems.

4. **Response Structure Consistency**: Ensure consistent response structures across all endpoints to make frontend integration easier.

## Next Steps

1. Review and potentially refactor the original validation function to understand why it was failing

2. Add more comprehensive logging throughout the application

3. Consider implementing a more robust error handling system application-wide

4. Add unit tests for the API key validation and GitHub summarizer functionality
